# GovCMS8 Project Scaffolding

## Known Issues

* This repository is still a Work-in-Progress, and may be subject to slight alterations

## Requirements and Preliminary Setup

* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) - Follow documentation at https://docs.amazee.io/local_docker_development/local_docker_development.html to configure local development environment.

* [Mac/Linux](https://docs.amazee.io/local_docker_development/pygmy.html) - Make sure you don't have anything running on port 80 on the host machine (like a web server):

        gem install pygmy
        pygmy up

* [Windows](https://docs.amazee.io/local_docker_development/windows.html):    

        git clone https://github.com/amazeeio/amazeeio-docker-windows amazeeio-docker-windows; cd amazeeio-docker-windows
        docker-compose up -d; cd ..

* [Ahoy (optional)](http://ahoy-cli.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#installation) - The commands are listed in `.ahoy.yml` all include their docker-compose versions for use on Windows, or on systems without Ahoy.

## Project Setup

1. Checkout project repo and confirm the path is in Docker's file sharing config (https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/#file-sharing):

        Mac/Linux: git clone https://www.github.com/govcms/govcms8-scaffold.git {INSERT_PROJECT_NAME} && cd $_
        Windows:   git clone https://www.github.com/govcms/govcms8-scaffold.git {INSERT_PROJECT_NAME}; cd {INSERT_PROJECT_NAME}

2. Build and start the containers:

        Mac/Linux:  ahoy up
        Windows:    docker-compose up -d

3. Install GovCMS:

        Mac/Linux:  ahoy install
        Windows:    docker-compose exec -T test drush si -y govcms

4. Login to Drupal:

        Mac/Linux:  ahoy login
        Windows:    docker-compose exec -T test drush uli

## Commands

Additional commands are listed in `.ahoy.yml`, or available from the command line `ahoy -v`

## Development

* You should create your theme(s) in folders under `/themes`
* Tests specific to your site can be committed to the `/tests` folders
* The files folder is not (currently) committed to GitLab.
* Do not commit changes to `docker-compose.yml`, `lagoon.yml`, `.gitlab-ci.yml` or the Dockerfiles under `/.docker` - these will result in your project being unable to deploy to GovCMS SaaS

## Local Development - enable XDEBUG
Please find below the steps to enable XDEBUG on your local environment. 
The instructions are specific to PHPStorm and Chrome.

### Edit docker.compose.yml 
* Remove this line - `DEV_MODE: ${DEV_MODE:-false}`
* Add this line instead - `XDEBUG_ENABLE: "true"`
DO NOT COMMIT THIS FILE

### Copy docker folder to the host
* `docker cp govcms8-scaffold_test_1:/app .`

### Add server settings to PHPStorm
The settings can be seen in the screenshot below:

### Install and enable `Xdebug helper` extension in chrome 

## Image inheritance

This project is designed to provision a Drupal 8 project onto GovCMS SaaS, using the GovCMS8 distribution, and has been prepared thus

1. The vanilla GovCMS8 Distribution is available at [Github Source](https://github.com/govcms/govcms8) and as [Public DockerHub images](https://hub.docker.com/r/govcms8)
2. Those GovCMS8 images are then customised for Lagoon and GovCMS, and are available at [Github Source](https://github.com/govcms/govcms8lagoon) and as [Public DockerHub images](https://hub.docker.com/r/govcms8lagoon)
3. Those GovCMS8lagoon images are then retrieved in this scaffold repository.

## Configuration management

GovCMS8 has default configuration management built in. It assumes all configuration is tracked (in `config/default`).

1. Export latest configuration to `config/default`:

        Mac/Linux:  ahoy cex
        Windows:    docker-compose exec -T test drush cex sync

2. Import any configuration changes from `config/default`:

        Mac/Linux:  ahoy cim
        Windows:    docker-compose exec -T test drush cim sync

3. Import development environment configuration overrides:

        Mac/Linux:  ahoy cim dev
        Windows:    docker-compose exec -T test drush cim dev --partial


*Note*: Configuration overrides are snippets of configuration that may be imported over the base configuration. These (optional) files should exist in `config/dev`.
For example a development project may include a file such as `config/dev/shield.settings.yml` which provides Shield authentication configuration that would only apply to a development environment, not production.
